# ðŸ§  Flappy Bird AI with NEAT

This project implements an AI that learns how to play **Flappy Bird** using the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm. The AI controls the bird and learns through evolution and natural selection to survive and pass through pipes without human intervention.

## ðŸŽ® Game Description

In this version of Flappy Bird:
- The bird is controlled by an **artificial neural network**.
- The AI improves over generations using **NEAT**, a genetic algorithm that evolves network structures.
- The goal of the AI is to **maximize its survival time** by flying through pipes without crashing.

## ðŸ§¬ What is NEAT?

**NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** is an algorithm that:
- Starts with simple neural networks
- Evolves them over generations
- Automatically discovers the best architecture and weights to solve a task

This allows the AI to learn **without needing labeled training data** â€” it learns by trying and failing.
